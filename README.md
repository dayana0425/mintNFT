# Road To Web3: Week 1 - Mint NFT ðŸ¥³

### Tutorial Link: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy

**Side Note**: I didn't follow the tutorial exactly but I achieved the same outcome, I modified it to deploy on Polygon & used Hardhat instead of Remix.

### Questions:
1. What was the biggest lesson from this challenge?
      - The biggest lesson for me was learning that an NFTs metadata isn't stored on-chain. I used to think only the image was stored on IPFS but I didn't know that the metadata was stored on IPFS too. 
2. What did you like/dislike about this challenge? Why?
      - It was super cool learning how NFTs work & creating metadata that adheres to OpenSea's metadata standard! :) 
3. What do you want to build next?
      - Dynamic NFTs!
      - A UI for Minting NFTs.
      - NFTs that you can stake.
### How Did I Mint?
1. First, I used OpenZepplin's Smart Contract Wizard to create my ERC21 Smart Contract. [see here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard)
2. Then, I added code to only allow 1 mint per user and set the total NFT supply to 10. [see here](https://github.com/dayana0425/mintNFT/blob/main/contracts/MintNFT.sol#L14-L16)
3. I deployed my contract to Polygon Mumbai & then verified my contract. 
      1. Verifying your contract is important because it allows you to interact with your contract directly from PolygonScan! Once your contract is verified, PolygonScan provides a simple UI for read/write functions. 
      2. See below for how to verify your contract on PolygonScan from the Command Line. 
4. After verifying my contract, I uploaded my image for my NFT to Filebase. Then, I created my metadata file according to OpenSea's metadata standard. [see here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards)
      1. [Filebase Website](https://filebase.com/) for hosting NFT metadata/images on IPFS.
      2. You can view the associated metadata for my NFT in the `metadata1.json` file. It follows OpenSea's metadata standard.
5. I then connected my wallet & called the `safeMint()` function with my address & the link to my metadata stored on IPFS.
      1. Address: `0x858C60547fE069724B017c8e42c4b27BE4F151C6`
      2. URI: `ipfs://QmbJ4tJAgTMuBLUheCYZezjHSKnUwyBYa9qN8xxRxYYXjM`

    1. That's it!

### Compile your smart contract:
```
yarn compile
```
### Deploy to Polygon Mumbai testnet:
```
yarn deploy
```
### Output after deployinh:
```
Using address 0xC0c630f5c9A78A75a92617852AD0F4E80BF252Cf
Wallet balance 0.7624262968620278
